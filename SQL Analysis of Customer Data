--I queried a database with multiple tables using MySQL in order to quantify and analyze statistics about customer and order data.

--Q1: How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Q2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Q3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Q4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--Q5: What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product,ROUND((SUM(quantity)*price), 2) AS revenue
FROM jansales
GROUP BY product;

--Q6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, orderdate, SUM(quantity) * price As total_revenue 
FROM febsales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--Q7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) AS num_of_customers,
ROUND(AVG(quantity*price), 2) AS average_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Q8: List the orders placed between 2/13/19 and 2/18/19.
SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';

--Q9: Find the address for the order placed on 2/18 at 1:35.
SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';

--Q10: How many items were ordered on February 18?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

--Q11: List all the types of batteries available for sale.
SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%';

--Q12: List all the products with prices that end in $.99.
SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Price like '%.99';

--Q13: List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT DISTINCT product, SUM (quantity)
FROM febsales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY product;
